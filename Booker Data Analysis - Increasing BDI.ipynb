    "## Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The spectral features aren't showing any conclusive trends.\n",
    "2. There are just too many variables that seem to create bias. For example, I felt that the gender had a role to play in spectral centroids calculation. There are instances where speaker is closer to the mic, which is shooting their RMS Energy a bit higher than the rest. \n",
    "3. After taking a look at the outputs, I felt that phonation and speech rate only were helpful.\n",
    "4. Just comparing ED sessions of different patients LACKS context. We need to change our approach, and try comparing ED and FU sessions.\n",
    "5. Another thing that I noticed was, there is no point to compare just ED and last FU session. Take patient 50051 for example. This patient had BDI values of 4 -> 6 ->7 -> 5 -> 2. So values first increase and then decrease. This proves that we can't expect a steady increase or decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. After listnening to some FU sessions, I feel that we should be focussing on comparing a patient's speech in ED and FU for BETTER CONTEXT. Comparing patient A's audio features with patient B isn't giving us a very clear idea. Also, I felt that for a certain BDI x, the patients might have very different styles of speaking. While some patients were super-talkative, there were some patients that couldn't speak much, yet had the same BDI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Should I try to use some sort of ML model? Since I can't observe any trends from simply observing myself.\n",
    "2. Should I try to compare a patient's ED and FU sessions to see fluctuations? I think this would provide a better baseline. Comparing the same patient's audio throughout their therapy could give us insights about how well their therapy is progressing, isn't it?\n",
